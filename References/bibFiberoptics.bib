Two different kinds of {STH}’s are considered: {STH}1, consisting of a hole trapped at the 2p nonbonding orbital of an O atom bridging two Si atoms, and {STH}2, a metastable defect where the hole is rapidly tunneling between two adjacent O atoms that we modeled by a hole delocalized over two bridging O atoms. The computed hyperfine coupling constants for the two variants of {STH} centers fully support the experimental assignments based on the analysis of the electron spin resonance spectra.

Furthermore, in certain conditions, {RIA} increases with irradiation temperature, which is a very rare phenomenon.

The structure and electron spin resonance ({ESR}) parameters [hyperfine coupling constants (hfcc’s) and g factors] have been determined for the two classical variants of {STH}’s: {STH}1, consisting of a hole trapped at the 2p nonbonding orbital of an O atom bridging two Si atoms, and {STH}2, a metastable defect where the hole is delocalized over the 2p orbitals of two bridging O atoms.

Standard hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, or pure {DFT} functionals, such as {BLYP}, fail completely in describing the two defects. According to these results, {STH}2 can form only in correspondence of specific O-Si-O angles of about 80°–90°, which classifies the defect center as a molecular polaron.},

	shorttitle = {Self-trapped holes in pure-silica glass},
	abstract = {It has long been assumed that hole self-trapping should take place in amorphous silicon dioxide (a-{SiO}2). However, no spectroscopic evidence for this was claimed before 1989, when the author used electron spin resonance ({ESR}) to identify self-trapped holes ({STHs}) in bulk samples of low-{OH} pure fused silica X irradiated ⩽100 K, and Chernov et al. reported a low-temperature infrared absorption near 1600 nm in irradiated pure-silica-core fibers, which they ascribed to {STHs}. Based on g values and 29Si and 17O hyperfine coupling constants measured by {ESR}, Griscom [D.L. Griscom, Phys. Rev. B 40 (1989) 4224; D.L. Griscom, J. Non-Cryst. Solids 149 (1992) 137] deduced the existence of two types of {STHs}: {STH}1 (a hole trapped on a single bridging oxygen) and {STH}2 (a hole delocalized over two equivalent bridging oxygens of the same {SiO}4 tetrahedron). The validity of Griscom’s models for {STH}1 and {STH}2 are supported by the ab initio calculations of Pacchioni and Basile [G. Pacchioni, A. Basile, Phys. Rev. B 60 (1999) 9990] and Gabriel [M.A. Gabriel, {PhD} dissertation, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, {WA}, in preparation]. In 1984, Nagasawa et al. reported that low-{OH}-pure-silica-core optical fibers γ irradiated at ∼300 K exhibit metastable optical absorption bands at 660 and 760 nm. Griscom [D.L. Griscom, J. Non-Cryst. Solids 349 (2004) 139] recorded these same bands in low-{OH}-pure-silica-core fibers γ irradiated at 77 K, showing their isochronal annealing behaviors to correlate with his earlier {ESR} data for {STHs} in bulk silica and also with Harari et al.’s data [E. Harari, S. Wang, B.S.H. Royce, J. Appl. Phys. 46 (1975) 1310] for trapped positive charges in silica thin films following X irradiation at 77 K. Sasajima and Tanimura [Y. Sasajima, K. Tanimura, Phys. Rev. B 68 (2003) 014204] established direct correlations of an induced band at 574 nm with {STH}2 by performing both {ESR} and a variety of optical measurements on three types of high-purity bulk silicas following pulsed electron irradiations at 77 K; however, these authors did not detect the 660 or 760 nm bands. Yamaguchi et al. [M. Yamaguchi, K. Saito, A.J. Ikushima, Phys. Rev. B 68 (2003) 153204] demonstrated that the yield of {ESR}-detected {STHs} photoinduced in bulk pure-silica samples at 77 K depends exponentially on fictive temperature (Tf). The present paper recounts the forgoing history in greater detail, while attempting to reconcile some seemingly disparate findings into a unified picture of {STHs} in silica. In the fall of 1998, a number of satellites in orbit were tumbling out of control due to failure of their {HeNe} ring-laser-gyro ({RLG}) attitude control systems. The author, acting in the capacity of pro-bono {US} government consultant, proposed the correct solution to this problem (replace Al-contaminated silica mirror coatings with high-purity ones). However, accelerated tests (short operation times at much-higher-than-normal laser powers) of the corrected devices failed to corroborate this fix. Thus, all further launches of satellites employing these {RLGs} remained grounded until the author was able to convince industry troubleshooters that (1) the accelerated test failures were due to the 660-nm {STH} band (which is induced even in the highest-purity silica coatings by 20-{eV} photons emitted by the laser plasma), (2) the strength of this band is initially proportional to ionizing dose rate (inevitably giving false positives in accelerated tests), and (3) this band eventually disappears after several months of irradiation, even at dose rates as low as 0.15 Gy/s. All of these insights derived from curiosity-driven components of the author’s research.},

In the thermally grown silicon dioxide films, earlier work is extended by demonstrating that the hole trapping process is reversible; no complex structural rearrangement occurs at the hole trapping site (E′ centers) after subsequent electron capture. This provides furtheer evidence that these thermal oxide E′ centers are oxygen vacancies as originally proposed by Feigl. Fowler and Yip. Also investigated is the radiation-induced generation of paramagnetic centers in high surface area sol-gel silicates containing various concentrations of the Raman active 608 cm−1 D2 band attributed to strained cyclic trisiloxanes (three-membered rings). The results suggest a correlation between the concentration of the strained three-membered rings and the concentration of radiation-induced E′ and paramagnetic oxygen centers, thus providing the first substantive evidence of the relationship between a specific strained siloxane structure and radiation damage in amorphous silicon dioxide. These results suggest the existence for (1) two different fundamental E′ precursors and (2) a relationship between atomic level stress and the radiation damage process in amorphous silicon dioxide.},

A micro-Raman study revealed a gaussian band peaking at 896 cm−1 with a full width at half maximum of 32 cm−1, which could be detected by exciting the sample with the 325-nm line of a {HeCd} laser. This spectral feature is absent in the Raman spectra performed with the 442-nm line of the same laser.

	abstract = {A new efficient algorithm is presented for finding all simple cycles that satisfy a length constraint in a directed graph. When the number of vertices is non-trivial, most cycle-finding problems are of practical interest for sparse graphs only. We show that for a class of sparse graphs in which the vertex degrees are almost uniform, our algorithm can find all cycles of length less than or equal to \$k\$ in \$O((c+n)(k-1)d{\textasciicircum}k)\$ steps, where \$n\$ is the number of vertices, \$c\$ is the total number of cycles discovered, \$d\$ is the average degree of the graph's vertices, and \$k {\textgreater} 1\$. While our analysis for the running time addresses only a class of sparse graphs, we provide empirical and experimental evidence of the efficiency of the algorithm for general sparse graphs. This algorithm is a significant improvement over the only other deterministic algorithm for this problem known to us; it also lends itself to massive parallelism. Experimental results of a serial implementation on some large real-world graphs are presented.},

The {RIA} difference between the polarizations was found to be largest at −60 °C, smaller at {LNT} and smallest at {RT}. At −60 °C, {RIA} for light codirected with the slow axis ({RIAslow}) proved to be greater than {RIAfast} throughout the spectrum, the {RIA} difference at λ = 1550 nm being 15\% at the end of irradiation at a dose of 1 {kGy} (0.80 Gy/s) and increasing to 51\% already in 10 min of post-irradiation recovery. {RIAslow} and {RIAfast} spectra measured at −60 °C were decomposed into {RIA} bands due to different types and classes of self-trapped holes ({STHs}) in the silica network. The origin of the {RIA} difference at λ = 1550 nm was thus explained in terms of the specific {STH} bands, of which the amplitudes turned out to be polarization dependent.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse s'inscrit dans le cadre du projet de recherche {CERTYF} dont l’objectif est l’amélioration des connaissances sur les processus de dégradation des fibres optiques à base de silice utilisées dans des environnements sévères combinant des contraintes d’irradiation, d'hydrogène et de température (R-H-T). Lorsqu'elle est exposée à un rayonnement, la fibre optique devient moins guidante en raison de la création de défauts. Ces défauts sont caractérisés par des niveaux d'énergie dans la bande interdite du matériau. Ainsi, lorsque la lumière est injectée à l'intérieur d'une fibre optique, la partie transmise de cette lumière diminue et inversement, l’atténuation radio-induite ({ARI}) augmente. Les objectifs du contrôle de l’{ARI} sont de développer des systèmes à base de fibres optiques tolérants aux radiations, capables de fonctionner dans les lieux de stockage de déchets radioactifs ou au contraire d'améliorer la sensibilité des fibres lors de leur utilisation pour la détection de la dose ou du débit de dose de rayonnement présent dans l'environnement radiatif. Ce travail est centré sur la construction d'un modèle physique capable de prédire l’{ARI} dans cet environnement sévère à travers une étude expérimentale basée sur la thermoluminescence ({TL}) et la spectroscopie d’absorption conduisant à la compréhension des mécanismes de création de défauts radio-induits. L’{ARI} qui en résulte est un processus complexe dépendant de plusieurs paramètres tels que la longueur d'onde, la dose, le débit de dose, la température et la composition des fibres. Tous ces paramètres qui doivent être pris en compte dans la modélisation reflètent les nombreux problèmes qui limitent l'intégration de la fibre dans des environnements combinés.},

Detailed procedures for preparing amorphous silica from crystalline silica are presented and the atomic structure is in good agreement with experimental results. Tensile properties of silica are predicted over a wide range of strain rates (2.3 × 108 s−1–1.0 × 1015 s−1) allowing comparison with results reported in the literature for other force fields. Quasi-static modulus obtained from power-law fitting of the low-stain rate modulus predicted by {ReaxFF} is in good agreement with experimental results. A transition strain rate of approximately \$\$ 2.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}  \{{\textbackslash}text\{s\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{ - 1\} \$\$is identified where modulus increases rapidly to a plateau level. Tensile strength also increases significantly in this range of strain rate and plateaus at the theoretical upper bound for silica. A detailed study is presented to understand the mechanisms associated with strain rate effects on the overall stress–strain response of silica. Bond breakage which evolves into void growth leading to failure is predicted to occur at approximately 27 \% strain for all strain rates. Stress relaxation simulations indicates that the transition strain rate occurs when the characteristic time for high-strain rate loading and stress relaxation times are the same order. The effects of cooling rate and temperature on the structure and the stress–strain response of the silica glass are also investigated. Low-cooling rate and low-cooling temperature enhance the properties of silica.},

	abstract = {Silica ({SiO}2) is an abundant material with a wide range of applications. Despite much progress, the atomistic modelling of the different forms of silica has remained a challenge. Here we show that by combining density-functional theory at the {SCAN} functional level with machine-learning-based interatomic potential fitting, a range of condensed phases of silica can be accurately described. We present a Gaussian approximation potential model that achieves high accuracy for the thermodynamic properties of the crystalline phases, and we compare its performance (and performance–cost trade-off) with that of multiple empirically fitted interatomic potentials for silica. We also include amorphous phases, assessing the ability of the potentials to describe structures of melt-quenched glassy silica, their energetic stability, and the high-pressure structural transition to a mainly sixfold-coordinated phase. We suggest that rather than standing on their own, machine-learned potentials for silica may be used in conjunction with suitable empirical models, each having a distinct role and complementing the other, by combining the advantages of the long simulation times afforded by empirical potentials and the near-quantum-mechanical accuracy of machine-learned potentials. This way, our work is expected to advance atomistic simulations of this key material and to benefit further computational studies in the field.},

It is therefore important to understand them from a fundamental, i.e. microscopic, viewpoint.

The former class of materials is commonly termed amorphous or glassy, the latter crystalline. However, both classes share, many of the other physical properties of solids, e. g. , me­ chanical stability, resistance to shear stress, etc. The traditional macroscopic distinction between the crystalline and the glassy states is that while the former has a fixed melting point, the latter does not. However, with the availability and production of a large number of materials in both crystalline and amorphous states, and their easy inter-convertability, simple de­ finitions are not possible or at best imprecise. For the present purpose, it is sufficient to say that in contrast to the crystalline state, in which the posi­ tions of atoms are fixed into adefinite structure, ex­ cept for small thermal vibrations, the amorphous state of the same material displays varying degrees of de­ parture from this fixed structure. The amorphous state almost always shows no long range order. Short range order, up to several neighbors, may often be retained, although averaged considerably around their crystalline values. It is generally believed that the amorphous state is a metastable one with respect to the crystal­ line ordered state, and the conversion to the crystal­ line state may or may not be easy depending on the na­ ture of the material, e. g.},

	abstract = {The study of the propagation of phonons is an important tool to investigate the sometimes unexpected and puzzling dynamic properties of amorphous solids. At first, as a typical- example, we shall discuss the acoustic Properties of vitreous silica. In the second part of the review emphasis will be given to the anomalous low temperature properties of amorphous materials. A. Introduction. - The vibrational excitations in crystals are generally well understood. In perfect crystals the vibrational motion of undamped atoms is easily decomposed into independent normal modes. These modes are plane-wave excitations, called phonons, and are characterized by a frequency, wavevector and polarization vector. Anharmonic effects lead to a coupling between these modes resulting in a finite lifetime. In general crystal imperfections give rise to localized excitations which can also limit the phonon lifetime through elastic or inelastic scattering. In contrast,the situation is much more complex and much less understood in non-crystalline solids. The enormous simplification engendered by the periodicity of the crystalline structure is lacking. The proper normal modes are no longer plane-waves. One immediate consequence is that phonons are damped as in anharmonic crystals. This effect becomes more and more important as the phonon wavelength approaches the interatomic spacing. Therefore, the dispersion curve is smeared out more and more with increasing wavevector and phonons in the original sense do not exist any more. At low frequencies, i.e. in the long wavelength limit, however, glasses, like crystals, behave as elastic continua. A well defined dispersion relation exists, and both longitudinal and transverse sound waves have been directly observed in glasses up to frequencies of about 1+0 {GHz} by Brillouin scattering experiments. Most of the information on the vibrational properties of amorphous solids has been obtained at wavevectors close to the origin of the "Brillouin zone". There the main difference between the properties of crystals and disordered solids lies in the fact that in the latter, selection rules which are based on the long range order are violated. As a consequence many effects which show sharp features in crystals, are considerably broadened in the amorphous solid. In this review we restrict ourselves mainly to the propagation of long wavelength phonons. In the first part of this paper we will describe the propagation of phonons in vitreous silica. In the second part of the review emphasis will be placed on the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses in general. B. Phonon Scattering in Solids. - Like the atoms of an ideal gas, the phonons in a perfect harmonic dielectric crystal are free of interaction. Thus in such a sample a sound wave would not be attenuated. In fact at low temperatures high quality dielectric crystals approach this ideal behaviour. Similar properties are expected for amorphous dielectrics because long wave-length phonons are not sensitive to the underlying structure. However, we will see, that amorphous networks exhibit internal degrees of freedom which give rise to absorption processes much stronger than those observed in their crystalline counterparts. Neglecting a few exceptions, the mechanisms of phonon scattering may be divided into three categories: elastic scattering, resonant absorption,and relaxation absorption.},

Thermal annealing was performed post-irradiation from 200 ∘C to 800 ∘C, and concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing was performed at 800 ∘C. Optical absorption was measured over the range of 220 nm to 1100 nm. Gamma-radiation-induced attenuation peaks in sapphire at 260 nm, 300 nm, and 355 nm are observed under concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing through the transfer of electrons between precursor oxygen vacancy and divacancy sites and the increased mobility of vacancy sites. It is shown that concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing does not restore the materials to their unirradiated state. Under concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing, high-{OH} content fused silica retained a radiation induced absorption band in the ultraviolet due to a 213 nm absorption band from unannealed E’ centers. Low-{OH} content fused silica retained an absorption band from 220 nm to 900 nm with multiple peaks generated from E’ centers. Sapphire retained an absorption band from 220 nm to 350 nm consistent with the transfer of electrons between precursor oxygen vacancy and divacancy sites, the additional production of oxygen vacancy sites from neutron interactions, and increased mobility of vacancy sites. These results help to inform optical material selection and placement to support the development of optical instrumentation in applications such as fission or fusion reactors.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is widely used for characterization of carbon-based materials including light-absorbing carbonaceous ({LAC}) matter. However, information on polarization properties of these materials are generally lacking, and often the polarization characteristics of experiments are not presented in the literature thereby giving uncertainty to presented data. In this work, the polarization properties of various {LACs} are studied using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra have been compared while varying the relative polarization, particularly the relative direction of the electric field between the incident light and the detected scattered light. Specifically, the intensity ratio between the D1 and G peaks ({ID}1/{IG}) was analyzed in parallel and perpendicular polarization configurations for samples taken from a sooting flame, in the exhaust of a soot generator and carbon blacks. In this work, the parallel and perpendicular polarization configurations mean that the polarization of the detected scattered light is parallel and orthogonal, respectively, to the linearly polarized incident light. It was found that the ({ID}1/{IG}) ratio decreased in the more ordered carbonaceous structures when changing the polarization configuration from parallel to perpendicular. Additionally, based on the depolarization ratios (Dp {\textless} 0.75), the prominent Raman peaks of {LAC} were found to originate from totally symmetric vibrations. For the G peak, the depolarization ratio was measured to be in the range 0.46–0.56 for all {LAC} materials.},

To provide a reference for the pure kesterite structure, we report the vibrational spectra—including both infra-red and Raman intensities—from lattice-dynamics calculations using first-principles force constants. Three-phonon interactions are used to estimate phonon lifetimes (spectral linewidths) and thermal conductivity. {CZTS} exhibits a remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity, competitive with high-performance thermoelectric materials.

	abstract = {Successful application of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides in optoelectronic, catalytic, or sensing devices heavily relies on the materials’ quality, that is, the thickness uniformity, presence of grain boundaries, and the types and concentrations of point defects. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful and nondestructive tool to probe these factors but the interpretation of the spectra, especially the separation of different contributions, is not straightforward. Comparison to simulated spectra is beneficial, but for defective systems first-principles simulations are often computationally too expensive due to the large sizes of the systems involved. Here, we present a combined first-principles and empirical potential method for simulating Raman spectra of defective materials and apply it to monolayer {MoS}2 with random distributions of Mo and S vacancies. We study to what extent the types of vacancies can be distinguished and provide insight into the origin of different evolutions of Raman spectra upon increasing defect concentration. We apply to our simulated spectra the phonon confinement model used in previous experiments to assess defect concentrations, and show that the simplest form of the model is insufficient to fully capture peak shapes, but a good match is obtained when the type of phonon confinement and the full phonon dispersion relation are accounted for.},

be used for sensor applications in high radiation fields in nuclear reactors. The darkening 
of the optical fibers in high radiation environments, resulting in the attenuation of signals, 
is a major concern for these applications. In this work, molecular dynamics ({MD}) 
simulations and first-principles electronic structure calculations are used to model and 
analyze the structural changes in glass fibers in high radiation environments and the 
corresponding changes in the electronic structure and optical properties. Besides the 
characterization of optically active defect structures in terms of vacancies or mis coordinated atoms, a number of approaches for identifying and analyzing structural 
changes upon heating and irradiation in the amorphous system are analyzed. First principles electronic structure calculations are used to correlate the structural properties 
of the defect structures to the resulting optical activity and to the resulting total 
attenuation. For this purpose, the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package ({VASP}) was used 
with {HSE} hybrid functional potentials, which allow accurate prediction of correct band 
gaps and optical properties. Computational results will be verified with the experimental 
setup, currently being developed in the Nuclear Engineering Department at {OSU}.},

	abstract = {The nuclear industry shows an increasing interest in the fiber optic technology for both data communication and sensing applications in nuclear plants. The optical fibers offer several advantages and the sensors based on this technology do not need any electrical power at the sensing point, they have a quick response and they can be easily multiplexed: in the case of a temperature sensor, several thermocouples can be substituted by a single fiber, resulting in a decrease of the waste material. The fission reactors are a very harsh environment: it is characterized by the highest dose of gamma-rays, of the order of magnitude of {GGy}, besides a high flux of neutrons and high operating temperature (300°C for the current reactors, known as generation {III}). This work has been carried out in collaboration with {AREVA}, a French industrial conglomerate active in the energy domain, with the aim of realizing a temperature sensor resistant to the environment of nuclear reactor of generation {IV}, in particular a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor. The currently used technology, the thermocouples, presents a drift of the measurement due to irradiation, that needs a calibration, and a long response time on the order of seconds. In order to remove the drift, to reduce the response time and to increase the precision, a Fiber Bragg Grating temperature sensor was chosen, in regard to all the advantages of the optical fibers. To understand the behavior of such system in a harsh environment, as the nuclear reactor core, we used an experimental approach based on complementary techniques such as radiation-induced attenuation, photoluminescence, electron paramagnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies},

This technique has already been applied to many challenging problems in materials characterization, from analysis of radiation damage, to colloidal crystals, to phonon-mediated thermal transport in nanostructured systems, to crystal orientation and lattice parameter determination. Examples of these applications, as well as inferring aspects of microstructural evolution, illustrate the wide potential reach of {TGS} to solve old materials challenges and to uncover new science.

It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few repeaters. Additionally, the per-channel light signals propagating in the fiber have been modulated at rates as high as 100 or higher gigabits per second, although 10 or 40 Gbit/s is typical in deployed systems. Innovations in optical fiber technology are revolutionizing communication, and data processing systems. Newly developed fiber amplifiers, for instance, allow for direct transmission of high-speed signals over transcontinental distances without the need for electronic regeneration. Optical fiber technology including fiber materials, devices, and systems has become a rapidly evolving field.

Today optical fibers are synonymous with the word “telecommunication”. In addition to applications in telecommunications, optical fibers are also utilized in the rapidly growing field of fiber sensors. Despite the improvements in optical fiber manufacturing and advancements in the field in general, basic optical components such as mirrors, wavelength filters, and partial reflectors have been a challenge to integrate with fiber optics. Recently, however, all these have changed with the ability to alter the core index of refraction in a single mode optical fiber by optical absorption of {UV} light. This photosensitivity of optical fibers allows the fabrication of phase structures in the core of fibers called the fiber Bragg grating (figure 2.1). Photosensitivity refers to a permanent change in the index of refraction of the fiber core when exposed to light with characteristic wavelength and intensity that depend on the core material. The fiber Bragg grating can perform many primary functions, such as reflection and filtering, in a highly efficient, low loss manner. This versatility has stimulated a number of significant innovations [1–3].},

	abstract = {This paper reviews what is known about the structures and optical properties of point defects in silica glass and other amorphous forms of {SiO}2. The available structural information derives mainly from the results of electron spin resonance ({ESR}) spectrometry-a method which is directly applicable only to the subclass of defects which are paramagnetic. The intrinsic paramagnetic centers so far identified by {ESR} include E' centers (≡Si·), nonbridging-oxygen hole centers (≡Si-O·), peroxy radicals (≡Si-O-O·), and self-trapped holes. Examples of intrinsic diamagnetic defects believed to occur in silica in include neutral oxygen vacancies (≡Si-Si≡), two-coordinated silicone (O-Si-O-), and peroxy linkages (≡Si-O-O-Si≡). The most common extrinsic defects are associated with hydroxyl and chloride impurities. Radiolytically induced H0 and H2 play important roles in the post-irradiation growth and decay kinetics of defects in glasses containing\_??\_100ppm {OH}. A compendium of {ESR}/optical correlations taken from the literature points to the most likely origins of many defect-related optical absorption bands in the visible, ultraviolet and vacuumultraviolet spectral regions. Others of these bands have been ascribed to interstitial O2, O3 and Cl2 molecules on the basis of similarities of their spectral positions and widths to those of the corresponding species in the gas phase.},

In recent years, major efforts have been made in the development of highly transparent glasses, able to resist ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. However the widespread application of many silica-based technologies, particularly silica optical fibers, is still limited by the radiation-induced formation of point defects, which decrease their durability and transmission efficiency. Although this aspect has been widely investigated, the optical properties of certain defects and the correlation between their formation dynamics and the structure of the pristine glass remains an open issue. For this reason, it is of paramount importance to gain a deeper understanding of the structure–reactivity relationship in a-{SiO}2 for the prediction of the optical properties of a glass based on its manufacturing parameters, and the realization of more efficient devices. To this end, we here report on the state of the most important intrinsic point defects in pure silica, with a particular emphasis on their main spectroscopic features, their atomic structure, and the effects of their presence on the transmission properties of optical fibers.},

	doi = {10.1366/000370275774455969},
	abstract = {The utility of Raman spectroscopy as a means of characterizing the properties of pure and doped fused silica has been investigated. Laser-Raman spectra were obtained by forward scattering from solid optical fibers {\textasciitilde}35 to 85 m in length using 514.5 nm excitation with an "image slicer" and a Cary model 81 instrument. Clad and unclad fibers of fused silica and doped fibers having {SiO}2-{GeO}2 and {SiO}2-{GeO}2-B2O2 cores were examined. Raman spectra were also obtained from bulk samples of glasses, including pure {GeO}2, pure B2O3, and various compositions of {SiO}2-{GeO}2, {SiO}2-B2O3, and {SiO}2-{GeO}2-B2O3. The addition of dopants to fused silica was found to alter the Raman spectrum both by the appearance of new bands, roughly proportional to dopant concentration and not common either to the fused silica or to the dopant alone, and by the marked alteration of other Raman bands, which is indicative of changes in the local intermolecular order. Thus, addition of {GeO}2 produces new Raman bands at {\textasciitilde}675 and {\textasciitilde}1000 cm−1; and of B2O3, new bands at {\textasciitilde}940 and {\textasciitilde}1350 cm−1. Addition of {GeO}2 and/or B2O3 weakens the relatively sharp Raman lines near 485 and 600 cm−1 (and a similar but small effect was also noted with increasing {OH} content). {GeO}2 and B2O3 together also produce observable narrowing of the broad intense 440 cm−1 Raman contour. These spectral effects are interpreted, respectively, in terms of a decrease in the concentrations of [Equation] and [Equation] defects produced by dopant addition and of a concomitant reordering of the silica structure. Raman spectroscopy thus appears to be a useful optical technique for elucidating the properties of dopants that have been especially chosen for good optical transmission and hence are not easily detectable by absorption measurements.},

In this paper we report on a detailed analysis of gamma irradiation tests done on Germanium-doped single-mode fibers at very low temperatures of 16 K. The drastic change in radiation response is shown with varying temperatures through measurements with discrete light sources and a spectral measurement system. To monitor the temperature in the fibers, Fiber-Bragg-Gratings ({FBG}) were used and their response under radiation observed. The findings will be valuable for determination of the temperature dependence of the point-defect formation as well as for specialized applications at low temperatures, such as accelerators or deep space missions.},

Radiation induced attenuation measured in two single-mode fibre types shows discrepancies when coiled around a low bending radius spool: the observed attenuation is lower than expected. A series of dedicated tests reveals that this invalid measurement is related to the displacement of the mode field towards the cladding when the fibre is bent with a low radius, and to the different radiation resistances of the core and cladding glasses. For irradiation tests of optical fibres, the spool radius should therefore be carefully chosen.},

	abstract = {Silica-based optical fibers, fiber-based devices and optical fiber sensors are today integrated in a variety of harsh environments associated with radiation constraints. Under irradiation, the macroscopic properties of the optical fibers are modified through three main basic mechanisms: the radiation induced attenuation, the radiation induced emission and the radiation induced refractive index change. Depending on the fiber profile of use, these phenomena differently contribute to the degradation of the fiber performances and then have to be either mitigated for radiation tolerant systems or exploited to design radiation detectors and dosimeters. Considering the strong impact of radiation on key applications such as data transfer or sensing in space, fusion and fission-related facilities or high energy physics facilities, since 1970′s numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to identify the microscopic origins of these changes. The observed degradation can be explained through the generation by ionization or displacement damages of point defects in the differently doped amorphous glass ({SiO}2) of the fiber's core and cladding layers. Indeed, the fiber chemical composition (dopants/concentrations) and elaboration processes play an important role. Consequently, identifying the nature, the properties and the generation and bleaching mechanisms of these point defects is mandatory in order to imagine ways to control the fiber radiation behaviors. In this review paper, the responses of the main classes of silica-based optical fibers are presented: radiation tolerant pure-silica core or fluorine doped optical fibers, germanosilicate optical fibers and radiation sensitive phosphosilicate and aluminosilicate optical fibers. Our current knowledge about the nature and optical properties of the point defects related to silica and these main dopants is presented. The efficiency of the known defects to reproduce the transient and steady state radiation induced attenuation between 300 nm and 2 µm wavelength range is discussed. The main parameters, related to the fibers themselves or extrinsic - harsh environments, profile of use - affecting the concentration, growth and decay kinetics of those defects are also reviewed. Finally, the main remaining challenges are discussed, including the increasing needs for accurate and multi-physics modeling tools.},

However, a long-term recovery, including the heating of the fiber from cryogenic temperature to room temperature, anneals a large amount of the defects created and brings the fiber back to almost its initial performance.},

The new method is an extension of an existing {DFT}−{GIAO} program package for the calculation of the chemical shift of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; full use is made of the conceptual analogy between the g-tensor and the chemical shift. The new program is applied to various small radicals. The agreement of calculated and experimental g-tensors is good for radicals of first-row elements; experimental trends are generally well reproduced. The quality of calculated results is worse if the scheme is applied to compounds of heavier elements. Possible reasons for these apparent shortcomings of the method are discussed.},

	abstract = {Modern density functional methods have been used to study spin-density distribution, g tensors, as well as Cu and ligand hyperfine tensors for azurin models, for two more blue copper proteins plastocyanin and stellacyanin, and for small model complexes. The aim was to establish a consistent computational protocol that provides a realistic description of the {EPR} parameters as probes of the spin-density distribution between metal and coordinated ligands in copper proteins. In agreement with earlier conclusions for plastocyanin, hybrid functionals with appreciable exact-exchange admixtures, roughly around 50\%, provide the best overall agreement with all parameters. Then the bulk of the spin density is almost equally shared by the copper atom and the sulfur atom of the equatorial cysteine ligand, and the best values are obtained for copper, histidine nitrogen, and cysteine β-proton hyperfine couplings, as well as for g{\textbar}{\textbar}. Spin-orbit effects on the {EPR} parameters may be appreciable and have to be treated carefully to obtain agreement with experiment. Most notably, spin-orbit effects on the 65Cu hyperfine coupling tensors in blue copper sites are unusually large compared to more regularly coordinated {CuII} complexes with similar spin density on copper. In addition to the often emphasized high covalency of the Cu−S(Cys) bond, the characteristically small A{\textbar}{\textbar} component of blue copper proteins is shown to derive to a large part from a near-cancellation between negative first-order (Fermi contact and dipolar) and unusually large positive second-order (spin-orbital) contributions. The large spin-orbit effects relate to the distorted tetrahedral structures. Square planar dithiolene complexes with similar spin density on copper exhibit much more negative A{\textbar}{\textbar} values, as the cancellation between nonrelativistic and spin-orbit contributions is less complete. Calculations on a selenocysteine-substituted variant of azurin have provided further insight into the relations between bonding and {EPR} parameters.},

Moreover, all previous calculations took into account the accumulated concentrations at the end of the irradiation, whereas we have considered an additional period of time after the excitation which allows for the relaxation of carriers in the bands. This simulates the experimental conditions more accurately because during this time any charge carriers which may have accumulated in the conduction and valence bands will relax into the traps and centers and, in doing so, will contribute to the final concentration of trapped charge. In our calculations we have allowed for this by letting the charge in the bands decay for a period of time T following the cessation of the irradiation (which occurs at time t). Thus, the level of trapped charge n is calculated at time t+T and this is taken to be a better representation of the trapped charge density. Results were obtained for very high and very low dose rates (intensities) of the radiation. Experimental findings of the dose dependence of thermoluminescence ({TL}) are susceptible to analysis by the approach developed by us. By adding a competing trapping level and changing the set of equations appropriately, we get a set of five simultaneous differential equations. In this way we can test the previous approximative results yielding a superlinear filling of one of the traps. It is found that, under an appropriate choice of parameters, superlinearity emerges, although the results are not identical to those of the previous approximations. In addition, an important result to emerge from the analysis is the possible dependence of {TL} output on the dose rate for a constant total dose. Recent experimental results of such a dependence on {TL} in quartz are shown to be in general accord with the numerical results.},

	abstract = {Formalisms have been developed to express the time evolution of bimolecular processes taking place in fractal spaces. These “stretched-second-order” solutions are specifically applicable to radiation-induced electron-hole pairs and/or vacancy-interstitial pairs in insulating glasses. Like the analogous Kohlrausch-type (stretched-first-order) expressions, the present solutions are functions of (kt)β, where 0{\textless}β{\textless}1,k is an effective rate coefficient, and t is time. Both the new second-order formalism and the familiar Kohlrausch approach have been used to fit experimental data (induced optical absorptions in silica-based glasses monitored at selected wavelengths) that serve as proxies for the numbers of color centers created by γ irradiation and/or destroyed by processes involving thermal, optical, or γ-ray activation. Two material systems were investigated: (1) optical fibers with Ge-doped-silica cores and (2) fibers with low-{OH}/low-chloride pure-silica cores. Successful fits of the growth curves for the Ge-doped-silica-core fibers at four widely separated dose rates were accomplished using solutions for color-center concentrations, N[(kt)β], which approach steady-state values, Nsat, as →t∞. The parametrization of these fits reveals some unexpected, and potentially useful, empirical rules regarding the dose-rate dependences of β, k, and Nsat in the fractal regime (0{\textless}β{\textless}1). Similar, though possibly not identical, rules evidently apply to color centers in the pure-silica-core fibers as well. In both material systems, there appear to be fractal classical phase transitions at certain threshold values of dose rate, below which the dose-rate dependencies of k and Nsat revert to those specified by classical (β=1) first- or second-order kinetics. For kt≪1, both the first- and second-order fractal kinetic growth curves become identical, i.e., N((kt)β)≈Atβ, where the coefficient A depends on dose rate but not kinetic order. It is found empirically that A depends on the 3β/2 power of dose rate in both first- and second-order kinetics, thus “accidentally” becoming linearly proportional to dose rate in cases where β≈2/3 (characteristic of random fractals and many disordered materials). If interfering dose-rate-independent components are absent, it is possible to distinguish the order of the kinetics from the shapes of the growth and decay curves in both fractal and classical regimes. However, for reasons that are discussed, the parameters that successfully fit the experimental growth curves could not be used as bases for closed-form predictions of the shapes of the decay curves recorded when the irradiation is interrupted.},

For the first time, the {RIA} spectrum is compared under γ-irradiation in a Panda and in a non-{PM} fiber drawn from the same preform before embedding the stress-applying rods. It is found out that the chief {RIA} origins in the near-{IR} range in both fibers are an extremely short-lived band centered at {\textasciitilde}1 {eV} and the tails of the classical bands due to strain-assisted self-trapped holes ({STHs}) at 1.63 and 1.88 {eV}. The former band is found to be many times more intense in the Panda; the latter bands, somewhat more intense in the non-{PM} fiber. The {\textasciitilde}1-{eV} band proved to be composed of two Gaussian sub-bands centered at 0.95 and 1.12 {eV}. Under γ-irradiation, the composite {\textasciitilde}1-{eV} band is found to be photobleached virtually fully by 1.55-μm light of 5-{mW} power, which results in manifold reduction of the total {RIA}. Upon pulsed irradiation, {RIA} in Pandas at large post-pulse times ({\textgreater}1 ms–1 s) is found to fall off below the record low level demonstrated elsewhere by a non-{PM} pure-silica-core fiber. This fact is explained as being due to a smaller concentration of strain-assisted {STHs} in Pandas than in non-{PM} fibers. The concentration of strain-assisted {STHs} in Pandas is shown to increase with increasing the value of birefringence.},

Today, among all fiber types, the {PSC} or F-doped ones have been demonstrated to be the most tolerant to the radiation induced attenuation ({RIA}) phenomenon and are usually used to design radiation-hardened data links or fiber-based point or distributed sensors. The here investigated {ULL}-{PSC} showed, instead, surprisingly high {RIA} levels of {\textasciitilde}3000 {dB}/km at 1310 nm and {\textasciitilde}2000 {dB}/km at 1550 nm at a limited dose of 2 {kGy}({SiO}2), exceeding the {RIA} measured in the P-doped {SM} fibers used for dosimetry for doses of {\textasciitilde}500 Gy. Moreover, its {RIA} increased as a function of the dose with a saturation tendency at larger doses and quickly recovered after irradiation. Our study on the silica structure suggests that the very specific manufacturing process of the {ULL}-{PSC} fibers applied to reduce their intrinsic attenuation makes them highly vulnerable to radiations even at low doses. From the application point of view, this fiber cannot be used for data transfer or sensing in harsh environments, except as a very efficient radiation detector or beam monitor.},

This raises the possibility that the stripping technique modifies the fiber surface. In this work it is shown that hot acid stripping does not affect the fiber strength. It does, however, remove a surface layer from the aged fiber, probably of hydrated silica, which does not contribute to the strength. Therefore, treatment with hot acid is necessary in order to reveal the strength controlling surface profile, even if there is no polymer coating requiring removal. {MeCl} does not remove the surface layer and does not reveal the strength controlling surface.},

	abstract = {Fiber Bragg grating ({FBG}) array, consisting of a number of sensing units in a single optical fiber, can be practically applied in quasi-distributed sensing networks. Serious signal crosstalk occurring between large-serial of identical {FBGs}, however, has limited the further increase in the number of sensing units, thus restricting applications only for short-distance sensing networks. To reduce the signal crosstalk, we design two novel types of 10-kilometer-long {FBG} arrays with 10 000 equally spaced gratings, written on-line using a customized grating inscription system, which is affiliated to a drawing tower. Main factors causing signal crosstalk, such as spectral shadowing and multiple reflections, are firstly investigated in theory. Consistent with the theoretical findings, experimental results are proving that ultra-weak (the reflectivity of ∼−40 {dB}) and multi-wavelength gratings of a number more than 10 000 can be readily identified, with satisfied low crosstalk. The maximum attenuation of grating signal and minimum signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) in a single-wavelength array are 10.69 {dB} and 5.62 {dB}, respectively. As a comparison, by increasing the number of central wavelengths to three, the attenuation can be effectively reduced to 5.54 {dB} and the minimum {SNR} has been improved to 8.14 {dB}. The current study significantly enhances the multiplexing capacity of {FBG} arrays and demonstrates promising potentials for establishing large-capacity quasi-distributed sensing networks.},

In simple, two-beam interferometers, this is achieved by comparing the phase of a light wave which has traversed a sensing path with the phase of another light wave originating from the same source but arriving via a protected, reference path. The phase difference can be measured with a sensitivity of {\textasciitilde} 10−6 of a wavelength [1] and the path length for the measuring interaction can be millions of wavelengths long. This implies a possible measurement resolution for the optical path of one in 1012! Simultaneously, the absence of free space optical paths between sources and detectors eliminates slow alignment drifts which could easily occur if bulk-optical interferometers had been used. However, in practice, these two-path interferometric sensors tend to need very stable, highly coherent sources with low phase noise in order to gain full advantage of their potential sensitivity. When such sources are used, absolute calibration of phase difference is normally not possible and a range limit arises because phase changes greater than π cannot be unambiguously distinguished from changes less than π. This is because the transfer function of these interferometers has a periodic response to phase difference, ϕ. In addition, the sensitivity of the output intensity to small phase changes around zero is itself zero. Optimum sensitivity occurs when ϕ = π/2, so two-path interferometers need to be biased at this phase difference for best performance.},

Their side-writing technique makes a Bragg grating directly in the fiber core using a holographic interferometer illuminated with a coherent ultraviolet ({UV}) source. Versatility in the fabrication of {FBGs} has been gained from the fact that the Bragg wavelength is independent of the writing laser used. Subsequent to this initial work the interest in {FBGs} has increased considerably in recent years.},

The sensing principles of both extrinsic and intrinsic optical fiber radiation sensors, including radiation-induced attenuation ({RIA}), radiation-induced luminescence ({RIL}), and fiber grating wavelength shifting ({RI}-{GWS}), were analyzed. The relevant advanced fiber materials and structures, including silica glass, doped silica glasses, polymers, fluorescent and scintillator materials, were also categorized and summarized based on their characteristics. The fabrication methods of intrinsic all-fiber radiation sensors were introduced, as well. Moreover, the applicable scenarios from medical dosimetry to industrial environmental monitoring were discussed.

	abstract = {The course of the changes produced by exposure in nuclear reactors and the subsequent alteration of the radiation-induced property changes caused by heating were followed by measuring the dilatation, refractive index, rotatory power, and birefringence. The fast-neutron dosages determined by a comparison of radiation damage in several substances are used to give a consistent scale for presenting the effects seen from the initial changes to nearly the saturation state, despite the many irradiation facilities used for the work. The property changes resulting from heating specimens irradiated to various extents are given. The damaging phenomena are explained in terms of the interaction of the scattered atoms with the silica structure, and the annealing phenomena in terms of the behavior of the anticipated structural changes. On the basis of the effect of displaced atoms and thermal spikes on solid structures there are delineated a number of classes of radiation damage among insulators. For one of these, silica is taken to be the prototype. Thermal spikes cause the displaced atoms to be accommodated by a local deformation, which is depicted as analogous to the rapid inversions in which a minor reorientation of the Si-O tetrahedra occurs without extensive disruption of the structure. The resulting gradually accumulating disorder is considered the basic formulation of a metamictization for which the damaging of quartz thus becomes the simplest example. The same basic processes are considered to take place in vitreous silica; but since the substance is already disordered, the changes which take place are minor, the slight compacting of the structure evidently representing mainly the partial freezing-in of a high-temperature state produced by the thermal spike.},

Bulk samples of the F-doped silica and of two other high-purity silicas (Suprasil F300 and F310) were studied by electron spin resonance ({ESR}) and isochronal annealing following exposure to (i) a γ-ray dose of 12 {MGy}(Si) and (ii) the same 12 {MGy} γ irradiation plus a subsequent fission-reactor irradiation. The strength of an optical band near 2 {eV} is shown to correlate with the intensity of the {ESR} spectrum of peroxy radicals ({PORs}) as a function of anneal temperature. The peak energy, band width, and oscillator strength of this band are determined to be E0=1.97±0.01 {eV}, W=0.17±0.01 {eV}, and {fPOR}=0.00057±0.00015, respectively. This {POR} band overlaps with, and has previously defied separation from, those of the non-bridging-oxygen hole centers ({NBOHCs}), here fitted by two bands (E0=2.19±0.01 {eV}, W=0.51±0.01 {eV} and E0=2.08±0.01 {eV}, W=0.32±0.01 {eV}) with an aggregate oscillator strength {fNBOHC}=0.00054±0.00015. The annealing processes of the {PORs} and {NBOHCs} displayed a dose-rate dependence, tentatively linked to the effect of dose rate (1 Gy/s vis-à-vis 5.3 Gy/s) on the steady-state self-trapped-hole populations, which in turn determine the equilibrium of radiolytic interstitial oxygen species: O0+O0⇌O2.},

	abstract = {This work aims at addressing the issue of the optical signature of peroxy bridges by using first-principles methods that combine density functional theory, {GW} (where G and W stand for one-particle Green function and screened Coulomb potential, respectively), and the solution of a Bethe–Salpeter equation on a bulk amorphous {SiO}2 model. We demonstrate that the presence of bridges induces broad and weak absorption bands between 3.2 and 7.5 {eV}. By analyzing the Si–O–O–Si dihedral angle distributions and the corresponding electronic structure, we show that the low overlap between O 2p states involved in the optical transitions together with the dihedral angle site-to-site disorder are at the origin of this weak and broad absorption. Moreover, the energy difference between the two first optical transitions depends linearly on the energy difference between the two first occupied defect-induced electronic states, i.e., depends on the dihedral angle of the bridge. This behavior may explain the longstanding controversy regarding the optical signature of peroxy bridges in amorphous {SiO}2. Because the correlation is independent of the specific hosting hard material, the results apply whenever the dihedral angle of the bridge has some degree of freedom.},

The structure of trapped electron sites in pure a-{SiO}2 is similar to that of Ge electron centers and so-called [{SiO}4/Li]0 centers in α quartz. Classical potentials were used to generate amorphous silica models and density functional theory to characterize the geometrical and electronic structures of trapped electrons in crystalline and amorphous silica. The calculations demonstrate that an extra electron can be trapped at a Ge impurity in α quartz in six different configurations. An electron in the [{SiO}4/Li]0 center is trapped on a regular Si ion with the Li ion residing nearby. Extra electrons can trap spontaneously on pre-existing structural precursors in amorphous {SiO}2, while the electron self-trapping in α quartz requires overcoming a barrier of about 0.6 {eV}. The precursors for electron trapping in amorphous {SiO}2 comprise wide (≥132∘) O–Si–O angles and elongated Si–O bonds at the tails of corresponding distributions.

The investigation is based on two complementary experimental techniques: radiation-induced attenuation ({RIA}) measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance ({EPR}). The latter technique allows measuring the P1, P2, metastable-{POHC} and stable-{POHC} defects. Three {OF} samples are drawn from the same preform to evaluate the influence of changing their drawing conditions of the {OFs} on the radiation responses. This first study is performed under X-rays at room temperature. The results are compared with the ones of γ-rays irradiation. The latter allows to highlight a linear correlation between the {NIR} absorption band at 1.6 µm and the {EPR} signal of P1 defects, which supports D. Griscom's assignment of this absorption band to the P1 defect. The combined effect of ionizing radiation and irradiation temperature is also investigated extensively: online {RIA} measurements as well as post-mortem {EPR} measurements for irradiation temperatures ranging from 25 to 280 °C and doses up to 3 {MGy} are performed. Both {RIA} and {EPR} data show that increasing the irradiation temperature can lead to an increased production of point defects and associated absorption bands. This result is of great importance for the employment of P-doped {OFs} in radiation environment.},

We compare their radiation response to those of two silica-based single-mode ﬁbers with germanium-doped and pure-silica cores. An X-ray pulse induces globally the same effects in all waveguides: a strong and transient increase of {RIA}. For higher tested doses (10 D 100 Gy), Air-{PCF} exhibits an interesting saturation of {RIA} at 0 1 {dB}/m. The possible mechanisms involved in this radiation response are discussed. In particular, we assume that the design of the photonic bandgap structure of the ﬁber, responsible for the light guidance in the air-core, could strongly affect the amplitude of {RIA}.

	abstract = {La raie zéro-phonon et bande satellite phonon constituent conjointement le profil spectral de molécules individuelles absorbant ou émettant de la lumière (chromophores) inclus dans une matrice solide transparente. Lorsque la matrice hôte contient de nombreux chromophores, chacun d'entre eux contribuera à la raie zéro-phonon et à la bande satellite phonon des spectres. Le spectre issu d'un ensemble de chromophores est dit élargi de manière inhomogène, chaque chromophore étant entouré par un environnement différent modifiant l'énergie requise pour une transition électronique. Dans une distribution inhomogène de chromophores, les positions de la raie zéro-phonon individuelle et de la bande satellite phonon sont donc décalés et se chevauchent.
La figure 1 illustre le profil typique de la raie pour des transitions électroniques de chromophores individuels dans une matrice solide. La raie zéro-phonon est localisée à la fréquence ω’ déterminée par la différence intrinsèque dans les niveaux d'énergie entre les états fondamental et excités ainsi que par l'environnement local. La raie satellite phonon est décalée vers une fréquence plus élevée en absorption et plus basse en fluorescence. L'écart de fréquence Δ entre la raie zéro-phonon et le pic de la bande satellite phonon est déterminée par le principe de Franck-Condon.
La distribution de l'intensité entre la raie zéro-phonon et la bande satellite phonon est fortement dépendante de la température. A température ambiante, il y a assez d'énergie thermique pour exciter de nombreux phonons et la probabilité de transition zéro-phonon est quasi nulle. Pour des chromophores organiques dans des matrices organiques, la probabilité d'une transition électronique zéro-phonon ne devient réellement possible qu'en dessous de 40 K, mais dépend également de l'intensité du couplage entre le chromophore et la matrice hôte.},

The analysis indicates that the E' centers are frozen in the optical fibers by a thermal activation process in the furnace.

	abstract = {The structure and radiation sensitivities of three different pure-silica-core fluorine-doped-cladding optical fibers, made from the same original preform, were investigated by several experimental techniques. The fibers were obtained by changing the drawing speed and tension in the typical ranges of values used for the radiation-tolerant waveguides. The Raman spectroscopy revealed no significant difference among the fibers before irradiation. At variance, the comparison between the fibers and their associated preform highlighted an increase in the amplitude of the D2 band that is related to the concentration of three-member rings. Moreover, in the zones where the D2 increase is larger, we observed that the R band peak shifts to higher energy values. The larger shifts are detected in the fluorine-doped cladding. These data suggest higher values of fictive temperature and density in the fibers with respect to the associated preform. The study of the concentrations of γ-ray induced nonbridging oxygen hole centers and E'Si centers provided no evidence for significant dependence on the investigated drawing conditions. Under γ-rays, a linear relation between the concentrations of these two defects is observed. These concentrations increase sublinearly with the dose suggesting the breaking of the Si-O-Si strained bonds as the main generation channel. Finally, under X-rays, we observed that C1-related defects are mainly responsible for the induced absorption at about 3.5 {eV}. These defects are unstable at room temperature and a bleaching of their related attenuation is observed 1h after the end of the irradiation.},

The excess oxygen is found to exist in the glass in two forms: as peroxy linkages and as interstitial molecular oxygen. The peroxy linkage is shown to be the cause of optical absorption at 3.8 {eV}. Heat treatment at 900–1000 °C results in the growth of the 3.8‐{eV} band, that is, the peroxy linkages, through the reaction of oxygen vacancies and interstitial dioxygen molecules. These results indicate that the 5.0‐ and 3.8‐{eV} bands (which are characteristic of ‘‘oxygen‐deficient’’ and ‘‘oxygen‐surplus’’ silica, respectively) can coexist in a glass, depending on the synthesis conditions.},

First, we evaluate their potential to serve either as parts of radiation tolerant optical or optoelectronic systems or at the opposite, for the most sensitive ones, as punctual or distributed dosimeters. Second, we improve our knowledge on combined ionizing radiations and temperature (R\&T) effects on radiation-induced attenuation ({RIA}) by measuring the {RIA} spectra in the ultraviolet and visible domains varying the R\&T conditions. Our results reveal the complex response of the tested ﬁbers in such mixed environments. Increasing the temperature of irradiation increases or decreases the {RIA} values measured at 25 C or sometimes has no impact at all. Furthermore, R\&T effects are time dependent giving an impact of the temperature on {RIA} that evolves with the time of irradiation. The two observed transient and stationary regimes of temperature inﬂuence will make it very difﬁcult to evaluate sensor vulnerability or the efﬁciency of hardening approaches without extensive test campaigns.},

	abstract = {A first-principles investigation of E′ centers in vitreous silica (v−{SiO}2) based on calculations of the electron paramagnetic resonance ({EPR}) parameters is presented. The {EPR} parameters are obtained by exploiting the gauge including projector augmented wave method as implemented in the quantum-espresso package. First, we analyze the {EPR} parameters of a large number of Si2 dimers. The g tensor of the Si2 dimers is shown to possess an average rhombic symmetry and larger g principal values with respect to those observed, e.g., for the E′γ center in silica. Furthermore, the g principal values clearly show a linear trend with the Si-Si dimer length. Our results suggest that the Si2 dimers could correspond to an unidentified paramagnetic center, though occasionally the calculated g principal values of the Si2 dimer might be compatible with those found experimentally for the E′δ center. Next, we generate nondimer configurations by a procedure involving structural relaxations in the subsequent positively charged states. In particular, puckered, unpuckered, doubly puckered, and forward-oriented configurations are generated. The distributions of the calculated {EPR} parameters of the puckered and unpuckered configurations further support the assignment of the E′γ center to an unpaired spin localized at a threefold coordinated silicon dangling bond. Moreover, by analyzing Fermi contacts and g tensors of the puckered and forward-oriented configurations, we suggest the assignment of the E′α center to the latter type of configurations. This work also suggests that the differences in the {EPR} parameters of E′α and E′γ centers mainly arise from the strained geometry of the silicon dangling bond. In the forward-oriented configurations, one Si-O bond is about 0.2 Å longer than the remaining two, whereas in the silicon dangling bond of the puckered and unpuckered configurations, all three bonds have a length of ∼1.6 Å each.},

However, using these sensors in magnets for fusion devices presents unique challenges from the combination of low operating temperatures and high radiation doses. In particular, Radiation Induced Attenuation ({RIA}) can cause severe signal degradation. One way to reduce {RIA} is Optical Annealing, in which high-intensity light propagating along the fiber is used to temporarily remove the defects responsible for {RIA}. Here we present measurements of {RIA} in Fluorine-doped single mode fibers subjected to up to 1.2 {MGy} of gamma irradiation while maintained at 77 K. Optical annealing with 200 {mW} of 970 nm light increased the survivable dose by a factor of 2000 relative to a minimally annealed fiber, but the effect was significantly reduced when the sample length was extended from 45 to 205 m.},

	abstract = {© 2021 {IOP} Publishing Ltd. Fiber-optic thermometry has the potential to provide rapid and reliable quench detection for emerging large-scale, high-field superconducting magnets fabricated with high-temperature-superconductor ({HTS}) cables. Developing non-voltage-based quench detection schemes, such as fiber Bragg grating ({FBG}) technology, are particularly important for applications such as magnetic fusion devices where a high degree of induced electromagnetic noise impose significant challenges on traditional voltage-based quench detection methods. To this end, two fiber optic quench detection techniques - {FBG} and ultra-long {FBG} ({ULFBG}) - were incorporated into two vacuum pressure impregnated, insulated, partially transposed, extruded, and roll-formed ({VIPER}) high-current {HTS} cables and tested in the {SULTAN} facility, which provides high-fidelity operating conditions to large-scale superconducting magnets. During surface heater induced quench-like events under a variety of operating conditions, {FBG} and {ULFBG} demonstrated strong signal-to-noise ratios ({SNRs}) ranging from 4 to 32 and measured single-digit temperature excursions; both the {SNR} and temperature sensitivity increase with temperature. Fiber thermal response times ranged between effectively instantaneous to a few seconds depending on the operating temperature. Strain sensitivity dominates the thermal sensitivity in the conditions achievable at {SULTAN}; however, measurements at higher quench evolution temperatures, coupled to future work to increase the thermal-to-strain signal, show promise for quench detection capability in full-scale magnets where temperature and strain may occur simultaneously. Overall, {FBG} and {ULFBG} were proven capable to quickly and reliably detect small temperature disturbances which induced quench initiation events for high current {VIPER} {HTS} conductors in realistic operating conditions, motivating further work to develop {FBG} and {ULFGB} quench detection systems for full-scale {HTS} magnets.},

	abstract = {The design of the {ITER} primary quench detection system is nearly completion, and the baseline is presented in this article. The paper describes the primary quench detection devices that will protect the magnets against the quench in the cable-inconduits conductors of the coils. The {CS} will be protected by one system based on co-wound tapes, and another making use of voltage taps only, complemented by a real-time calculation of the inductive noise called {MIK}. The {TF} will be protected by a set of co-wound tapes, plus a second stage of compensation performed numerically. A classical balance-bridge using part of the voltage taps of the ﬁrst system will also be used. The two other systems, {PF} and {CC} will be protected by balance bridges. In the {PF}, the symmetrical conﬁguration of the two-in-hands winding style will be used. In the {CC}, the compensation will be done using doublepancakes of the same coil. These electromagnetic quench detection systems have been designed to allow progressive improvements, and adjustments required by potential deviation from simulation to actual plasma operation.},

This paper critically reviews why the automotive sector can benefit from this relatively new approach for a variety of reasons. Moreover, a case study representative of the automotive field is analyzed and discussed. Specifically, an {SMT} methodology is applied to evaluate the modal properties of a reinforced composite roof belonging to a racing solar powered vehicle. In the experimental activity, signals from Fiber Bragg Grating ({FBG}) sensors, strain gauges, and accelerometers were simultaneously acquired and further processed. The advantages of using optical fibers were discussed, together with their weaknesses and ongoing challenges.

Narrow-beam transmission geometry has been used for the measurements. Samples of commonly used engineering materials (Cements, Clay, Lime-Stone, Plaster of Paris) have been selected for the present study. Standard radioactive sources Cs137 and Co60 have been used for obtaining γ-ray energies 661.66, 1173.24 and 1332.50 {keV}. The optical thickness ({OT}) of 0.5 mfp (mean free path) has been found the optimum optical thickness ({OOT}) for μm-measurement in the selected energy range (661.66–1332.50 {keV}). The aim of this investigation is to provide neglected information regarding subsistence of scattered photons in narrow beam geometry measurements for low-Z materials. The measurements have been performed for a wide range of sample-thickness (2–26 cm) such that their {OT} varies between 0.2–3.5 mfp in selected energy range. A computer program ({GRIC}2-toolkit) has been used for various theoretical computations required in this investigation. It has been concluded that in selected energy-range, good accuracy in μm-measurement of low-Z materials can be achieved by keeping their sample’s {OT} below 0.5 mfp. The exposure buildup factors have been measured with the help of mathematical-model developed in this investigation.},

	abstract = {Thermoluminescence dosimeters containing boron, such as magnesium tetraborate ({MgB}4O7), are of interest because of their very high sensitivity, near tissue-equivalent absorption coefficients, low cost, easy handling, and very large linearity range for absorbed dose. Another important parameter that should be considered when working with thermoluminescent dosimeter ({TLD}) is the mass energy absorption coefficient (μen/ρ), which is a close approximation to the energy available for production of chemical, biological and other effects associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, therefore important in estimating dose in medical and health physics. In this study the mass energy absorption coefficients and energy responses of undoped and some doped magnesium tetraborates were calculated by Monte Carlo N-particle transport code for a range of photon energies between 20 {keV} and 20 {MeV}. The calculated parameters for {MgB}4O7, {MgB}4O7:Dy and {MgB}4O7:Dy,Li were evaluated in comparison with standard {TLDs} as Al2O3:C and {TLD}-100 ({LiF}: Mg, Ti) and {ICRU} tissue data. The influence of the dopant concentration in the {MgB}4O7 matrix on the energy dependence of {TLD} was also investigated. The analyses indicated a good agreement between the simulations and theoretical calculations. The μen/ρ and energy dependence of the materials are higher in the low energy range (E {\textless} 100 {keV}), which is related to the high probability of interaction between radiation and matter due to photoelectric absorption. With regard to the influence of dysprosium concentration in the {MgB}4O7 matrix an increase in the energy dependence of {MgB}4O7 for higher concentrations of dopants was observed in the low energy range.},

	abstract = {A Savitzky–Golay filter is a digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data, that is, to increase the precision of the data without distorting the signal tendency. This is achieved, in a process known as convolution, by fitting successive sub-sets of adjacent data points with a low-degree polynomial by the method of linear least squares. When the data points are equally spaced, an analytical solution to the least-squares equations can be found, in the form of a single set of "convolution coefficients" that can be applied to all data sub-sets, to give estimates of the smoothed signal, (or derivatives of the smoothed signal) at the central point of each sub-set. The method, based on established mathematical procedures, was popularized by Abraham Savitzky and Marcel J. E. Golay, who published tables of convolution coefficients for various polynomials and sub-set sizes in 1964. Some errors in the tables have been corrected. The method has been extended for the treatment of 2- and 3-dimensional data.
Savitzky and Golay's paper is one of the most widely cited papers in the journal Analytical Chemistry and is classed by that journal as one of its "10 seminal papers" saying "it can be argued that the dawn of the computer-controlled analytical instrument can be traced to this article".},

	abstract = {Savitzky–Golay ({SG}) filtering, based on local least-squares fitting of the data by polynomials, is a popular method for smoothing data and calculations of derivatives of noisy data. At frequencies above the cutoff, {SG} filters have poor noise suppression; this unnecessarily reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, especially when calculating derivatives of the data. In addition, {SG} filtering near the boundaries of the data range is prone to artifacts, which are especially strong when using {SG} filters for calculating derivatives of the data. We show how these disadvantages can be avoided while keeping the advantageous properties of {SG} filters. We present two classes of finite impulse response ({FIR}) filters with substantially improved frequency response: (i) {SG} filters with fitting weights in the shape of a window function and (ii) convolution kernels based on the sinc function with a Gaussian-like window function and additional corrections for improving the frequency response in the passband (modified sinc kernel). Compared with standard {SG} filters, the only price to pay for the improvement is a moderate increase in the kernel size. Smoothing at the boundaries of the data can be improved with a non-{FIR} method, the Whittaker–Henderson smoother, or by linear extrapolation of the data, followed by convolution with a modified sinc kernel, and we show that the latter is preferable in most cases. We provide computer programs and equations for the smoothing parameters of these smoothers when used as plug-in replacements for {SG} filters and describe how to choose smoothing parameters to preserve peak heights in spectra.},

	rights = {In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/145063},
	abstract = {Accurate molten salt thermophysical properties are required to optimize the efficiency and safety of molten salt-based energy technologies. Unfortunately, existing thermal conductivity data for molten fluorides are plagued by large uncertainties. In addition, the data displays a curious positive temperature coefficient. Understanding of heat transfer in simple fluids suggests thermal conductivity should decrease as a function of temperature. Unaccounted-for contributions from convection and radiation may result in the observation of erroneous positive temperature coefficients. Interestingly, negative temperature coefficients have been observed in non-fluoride salts when measured using Transient Grating Spectroscopy ({TGS}). This work has shown that convection and radiation are insignificant for most {TGS} regimes. Therefore, it was hypothesized that {TGS} measurements of fluorides could finally resolve the discrepancies between theory and experiments. 
 
The design and validation of a first-of-a-kind fluoride salt compatible {TGS} setup is presented. Demonstration of system performance is achieved through the acquisition and comparison of sound speed and thermal diffusivity data in lithium chloride ({LiCl}). The system has subsequently been used to measure the thermal conductivity of fluorides ({FLiNaK}). Results show a flat to slightly increasing thermal conductivity as a function of temperature (0.7086 + 0.0002 ⋅ T({oC}) +/- 0.08 W/m-K). In addition to thermal conductivity, sound speed data as a function of temperature (2998 – 1.24 ⋅ T({oC}) +/- 27 m/s) has also been obtained for the first time in {FLiNaK}. The use of accurate sound speed data in theoretical models of thermal conductivity provides better, but not complete agreement with the results from {TGS}.  
 
The continued existence of a positive temperature coefficient poses more questions than it answers. Three new hypotheses are presented, namely, the influence of vapor pressure in multi-constituent salts, uncertainty surrounding existing heat capacity data, and the validity of neglecting diffusive contributions from theoretical models. Ultimately, this work suggests that fluoride molten salt thermal conductivity is weakly temperature-dependent. Reliable property data has far-reaching consequences for the size of heat exchangers, response to accident scenarios, or more broadly, the safe and efficient deployment of molten salt-based energy technologies.},

	abstract = {The elastic and thermal transport properties of opaque materials may be measured using transient grating spectroscopy ({TGS}) by inducing and monitoring periodic excitations in both reflectivity and surface displacement. The “phase grating” response encodes both properties of interest, but complicates quantitative analysis by convolving temperature dynamics with surface displacement dynamics. Thus, thermal transport characteristics are typically determined using the “amplitude grating” response to isolate the surface temperature dynamics. However, this signal character requires absolute heterodyne phase calibration and contains no elastic property information. Here, a method is developed by which phase grating {TGS} measurements may be consistently analyzed to determine thermal diffusivity with no prior knowledge of the expected properties. To demonstrate this ability, the wavelength-dependent 1D effective thermal diffusivity of pure germanium is measured using this type of response and found to be consistent with theoretical predictions made by solving the Boltzmann transport equation. This ability to determine the elastic and thermal properties from a single set of {TGS} measurements will be particularly advantageous for new in situ implementations of the technique being used to study dynamic materials systems.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this work was to determine the suitability of using instrumentation utilizing sapphire optical fibers in a nuclear reactor environment. In this work, the broadband (500–2200 nm, or 0.56–2.48 {eV}) optical transmission in commercially available sapphire optical fibers was monitored in-situ prior to and during reactor irradiation. The sapphire fibers were irradiated at a neutron flux of 1.5 × 1012 n/(cm2·s) and a gamma dose rate of 75 {kGy}/h (dose in sapphire) to a total neutron fluence of 1.1 × 1017 n/cm2 and total gamma dose of on the order of 1.5 {MGy}. Consistent with previous gamma irradiation experiments, an absorption band centered below 500 nm (the minimum measurable wavelength using the measurement system described in this work) and extending as far as 1000 nm reached saturation during irradiation in the gamma shut-down field (the gamma-ray radiation field that is present in the reactor post-operation, as a consequence of the decay of radioisotopes that were produced during reactor operation) of the reactor prior to reactor irradiation. Beginning reactor irradiation and increasing the reactor power caused rapid increases in attenuation, followed by a linear increase with irradiation time at constant reactor power. Shutting down the reactor caused a decrease in the added attenuation; however, restarting the reactor caused the added attenuation to rapidly return to values almost identical to those observed at the end of the previous irradiation. The decrease in attenuation that was observed after the reactor was shut down shows the importance of the in-situ nature of the measurements made in this work (previous ex-situ attenuation measurements could not have captured this effect). A model is proposed for the experimentally obtained values of the radiation-induced attenuation that involves three previously identified color centers including a composite V-center, a center, and a center. The model accounts for gamma radiation-induced ionization of pre-existing defects, generation of new defects via displacement damage, and conversion between defect centers via ionization and charge recombination.},

Thermal annealing was performed post-irradiation from 200 ∘C to 800 ∘C, and concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing was performed at 800 ∘C. Optical absorption was measured over the range of 220 nm to 1100 nm. Gamma-radiation-induced attenuation peaks in sapphire at 260 nm, 300 nm, and 355 nm are observed under concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing through the transfer of electrons between precursor oxygen vacancy and divacancy sites and the increased mobility of vacancy sites. It is shown that concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing does not restore the materials to their unirradiated state. Under concurrent-irradiation thermal annealing, high-{OH} content fused silica retained a radiation induced absorption band in the ultraviolet due to a 213 nm absorption band from unannealed E’ centers. Low-{OH} content fused silica retained an absorption band from 220 nm to 900 nm with multiple peaks generated from E’ centers. Sapphire retained an absorption band from 220 nm to 350 nm consistent with the transfer of electrons between precursor oxygen vacancy and divacancy sites, the additional production of oxygen vacancy sites from neutron interactions, and increased mobility of vacancy sites. These results help to inform optical material selection and placement to support the development of optical instrumentation in applications such as fission or fusion reactors.},

Such materials served to design the lenses of radiation-hardened cameras of the {FURHIS} Project intended to withstand {MGy} ({SiO}2) dose levels associated with {ITER} remote handling operations. {RIA} is monitored in situ in the 400- to 800-nm spectral domain for glass types ranging from radiation sensitive ({BK}7) to radiation hardened ones: pure silica, {BK}7G18, K5G20, and {SF}6G05 from {SCHOTT}. In addition to the detailed characterization of these various glasses, our study highlights the systematic underestimation of the {RIA} measured by the usual qualification approach consisting in postirradiation {RIA} measurements after dose steps. The error due to this underestimation is shown to strongly depend on the glass type, very large for the {BK}7G18 glass. This material is associated with high transient {RIA}, its loss levels exceed the ones of its nonrad-hard counterpart ({BK}7) at low dose levels. For the development of {MGy} radiation-hardened systems using these glasses, a vulnerability study of the in situ response of glass lenses appears mandatory. By improving our knowledge on the origin of these transient losses, appropriate hardening techniques to maintain the camera photometry budget will be tested in the future.},

By controlling excess oxygen in a-{SiO}2, and the conditions of F2-laser irradiation, {SiO}2 glass samples can be obtained with optical absorption almost exclusively dominated by single defect, oxygen dangling bonds (“non-bridging oxygen hole centers” or {NBOHCs}), without the presence of complementary Si dangling bonds (generic “E′-centers”). This allows for a more accurate determination of the spectral shape of {NBOHC} optical absorption in {UV} and vacuum {UV} spectral regions. The temperature dependence of {NBOHC} electron paramagnetic resonance ({EPR}) signal intensity is stronger than predicted by Curie’s law (1/T) even at temperatures at and below 77K. Dangling bonds are characteristic of an amorphous state and do not exist in a regular crystal lattice. However, site-selective luminescence shows that highly ordered {NBOHCs} exist in particle-irradiated α-quartz, evidently either on the border between the damage tracks and the crystalline phase or as a part of Si vacancies. They are different from the common “glass-like” {NBOHCs} in a-{SiO}2 by giving distinct sharp zero-phonon lines with characteristic energies in luminescence spectra instead of a continuous distribution of lines. Two distinct types of luminescent {NBOHCs}, associated with the long and short Si–O bonds in α-quartz are suggested. {EPR} data corroborate the presence of oriented {NBOHCs} in neutron-irradiated α-quartz and confirm distinct {NBOHCs} at the sites of “long” and “short” Si–O bonds in α-quartz.},

We used three standard fibers carrying around 2mW of light at 1550nm and 4, 0.4, 0.09 of the light at 1050nm respectively; and a fourth standard control fiber that carried no photobleaching light. We observed a large reduction in radiation-induced attenuation in all of the fibers with light at 1050nm when compared to the control fiber. This reduction, however is not linear and saturates for higher powers. These results are consistent with our theoretical models.},

Typically, the fiber core is exposed through the side of the cladding to {UV} radiation at a wavelength from 240 - 250 nm. Permanent phase gratings are 'written' with a specified period by using a pair of intersecting coherent beams. We have investigated the fiber photosensitivity by monitoring the grating reflectivity and wavelength spectrum during the exposure. The Bragg wavelength shifts as the grating is 'written' due to a small increase in the average refractive index of the core. From these measurements, one can determine the growth and saturation characteristics of the photoinduced changes and study the effects of composition and high temperature hydrogen annealing. We have also measured the polarization sensitivity and thermal stability of gratings and the transient and permanent changes in fiber absorption.},

We show that increasing the probe power (1550 nm) and injecting lower wavelength light (970 nm) both resulted in a significant reduction in {RIA} in both fiber types, where radiation-hard fibers were intrinsically more resistant to the {RIA}. Deconvolution of {RIA} growth curves revealed that the {RIA} was composed of transient and long-term growth components that were correlated with distinct radiation-induced defects specific to each fiber composition. The 1550 nm light more effectively suppressed the transient {RIA}, while 970 nm more effectively suppressed the long-term {RIA}. Ultimately, we show that cryogenic {RIA} may be effectively managed in fiber optic sensing systems using radiation-hard fibers and dual-wavelength photobleaching strategies.},

The ability to deploy rapid, multi-modal, non-destructive techniques provides valuable insight in microstructure evolution of radiation induced effects. The current work demonstrates the use of Transient Grating Spectroscopy ({TGS}) as a powerful technique to detect post irradiation changes in thermal diffusivity of polycrystal, high-purity, oxygen-free copper (Cu-{OF}) used in Radio-Frequency Quadrupoles ({RFQs}). For that purpose, the nominal operation proton beam losses of the European Spallation source ({ESS}) {RFQ} were studied to define copper sample irradiation patterns at {MIT} Tandetron accelerator that emulate the radiation damage conditions corresponding to 24 h of operation. Sample measurements with {TGS} before and after irradiation were performed in order to assess potential variation in copper thermal properties. Irradiated samples with energy of 120 {keV}, incident angles of 0°, 40° and fluence of 1017 p/cm2 at room temperature and resulted damage of 0.015 dpa presented a decrease in their thermal diffusivity which can be attributed to point defect generation and void formation.},

The established Allen-Feldman and Green-Kubo approaches employ approximations with limited validity—the former neglects anharmonicity, the latter misses the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics of vibrations—and require atomistic models that are very challenging for first-principles methods. Here, we present a protocol to determine from first principles the thermal conductivity κ(T) of glasses above the plateau (i.e., above the temperature-independent region appearing almost without exceptions in the κ(T) of all glasses at cryogenic temperatures). The protocol combines the Wigner formulation of thermal transport with convergence-acceleration techniques, and accounts comprehensively for the effects of structural disorder, anharmonicity, and Bose-Einstein statistics. We validate this approach in vitreous silica, showing that models containing less than 200 atoms can already reproduce κ(T) in the macroscopic limit. We discuss the effects of anharmonicity and the mechanisms determining the trend of κ(T) at high temperature, reproducing experiments at temperatures where radiative effects remain negligible.},

While much progress has been made in uncovering how phonons affect electron dynamics, it remains a challenge to directly observe the impact of electrons on phonon transport, especially at environmental temperatures. Here, we probe the effect of charge carriers on phonon heat transport at room temperature, using a modified transient thermal grating technique. By optically exciting electron-hole pairs in a crystalline silicon membrane, we single out the effect of the phonon–carrier interaction. The enhanced phonon scattering by photoexcited free carriers results in a substantial reduction in thermal conductivity on a nanosecond timescale. Our study provides direct experimental evidence of the elusive role of electron–phonon interaction in phonon heat transport, which is important for understanding heat conduction in doped semiconductors. We also highlight the possibility of using light to dynamically control thermal transport via electron–phonon coupling.},

	abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator {LAMMPS} was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single {CPU} core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to {LAMMPS} and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in {LAMMPS} are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.
Program Summary
Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator ({LAMMPS}) {CPC} Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: {GPLv}2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The {LAMMPS} code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel {FFTs} for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, {LAMMPS} supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the {LAMMPS} code.

However, several radiation environments, such as space and particle accelerators, require also a careful assessment of the temperature effect on these properties exploited for dosimetry. With this aim, we characterize their {RIL} efficiency and spectral dependence at several irradiation temperatures. We demonstrate that all the investigated materials present a non-negligible temperature dependence of the {RIL} in the range -120 °C to 80 °C. The temperature effect on the {RIL} signal is still compensable via calibration and temperature monitoring.},
